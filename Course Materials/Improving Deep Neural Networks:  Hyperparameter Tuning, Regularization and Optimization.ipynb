    "- Dropout is a regularization algorithm in which we randomally drop several weights (=0) for each layer during training process.\n",
    "- Dropout is used to spread out the effect of an individual weight through all weights, so that the final model does not exclusively rely on specific weights. \n",
    "- Inverse dropout (`/Keep-prob`) is used to make sure the expected values of Neurons remain same, otherwise, we have to perform more scaling during test time.\n",
    "- We do not normally do dropout during test, however, if we insist, we have to dropout and run several times and finally average over them which is computationally inefficient."

    "## What is a Neural Network? \n",

    "[Video Link](https://youtu.be/n1l-9lIMW7E)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that is designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the Housing Price Prediction example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a dataset of some houses & their prices. We want to fit a function to predict the price of the houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Size of house is the input data(x) & Price is the output(y).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, y = f(x) that means Price of house(y) is the function of Size of house(x).\n",
    "If we plot the data of Price and Size then we’ll get a graph like this-\n",
    "\n",
    "![houseprice](./images/houseprice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s draw a straight line using these data in the graph to visualize the trend of the data. Which will look like this-\n",
    "\n",
    "![houseprice2](./images/houseprice2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This straight line is representing the trend of house price concerning their sizes. We can find the price of any house if the size is known, by plotting the size into that straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to get the perfect straight line that represents the dataset perfectly, we use Linear Regression that is calculated by a Neuron in a Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Neuron in a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ve said earlier, Size of house is the input data(x) data & Price is the output(y) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we’ve done above is we’ve given some examples of Prices of houses concerning their sizes and with the help of those data we can predict the price of any house of any size which is not listed in the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here Neuron comes into action. We feed the input data(x) to a Neuron and get output(y) from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "![neuron](./images/neuron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest Neural Network example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it little more complex let’s assume the price of the house is dependent on other factors also. Like Family Size, No. of bedrooms, Walkability, Zip-Code, School quality & Wealth.\n",
    "Now all these factors are interrelated to each other, like-\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‘Walkability’ from one place to another depends on the address of the place(Zip-code).\n",
    "- ‘School quality’ is also dependent on the address. Like good renowned schools are more likely to be in the Wealthy & city area.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we place some of these factors to input layers and some of them to hidden layers.\n",
    "So as a whole the ‘price of the house’ now depends on all these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![neuron2](./images/neuron2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure,\n",
    "- The layer created by ‘Size’, ‘No. of bedrooms’, ‘ZipCode’, ‘Wealth’ is known as the **Input Layer of this neural network**.\n",
    "- The layer created by ‘Family size’, ‘Walkability’, ‘School Quality’ is known as the **Hidden Layer of the neural network**.\n",
    "- ‘Price’ is the **Output of the neural network**.\n",
    "So what we implement is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![neuron3](./images/neuron3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, rather than saying the first nodes represent ‘family size’ and it depends only on the features ‘x1’ and ‘x2’, we’re going to say, “well neural network, you decide whatever you want this known to be and we’ll give you all four of the features to complete whatever you want”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every input feature is connected to every one of these circles(Neuron) and the remarkable thing about neural networks is that given enough training examples with both ‘x’ and ‘y’, neural networks are remarkably good at figuring out functions that accurately map from ‘x’ to ‘y’.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Deep Learning taking off?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Video Link](https://youtu.be/xflCLdJh0n0)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple reasons for which deep learning is excelling over traditional machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "![scales](./images/scales.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above figure, we can see,\n",
    "- For traditional learning algorithms as the amount of data gets increased, the performance gets saturated after a certain point. So the peak performance achieved from the model of machine learning cannot be that high.\n",
    "- But for Neural Networks, as we keep going increasing the amount of data, the performance gets better as well. So to achieve the peak performance using deep learning, we need to feed lots of data to the neural network.\n",
    "Here’s where deep learning shines. It can perform much better than traditional machine learning algorithms when it comes to nurturing with lots of data."
